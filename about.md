## Hi, I'm Luke

I'm a father, software developer, and writer from Erie, Pennsylvania. But why tell you about myself when I can let robots do it?

### What Claude Says About Him
> Luke's this dude from Erie who somehow manages to be a Senior Software Engineer while also writing poetry about his recovery journey and existential dread—his Twitter bio literally used to say "Capri Sun, UNIX, poetry, web development" which is peak millennial chaos energy. He admits in his blog that he had to learn to stop being a control freak manager who couldn't let go of his coding opinions and trust his team, which is refreshingly honest but also like... bro, we get it, you're particular about your Laravel. Guy's legitimately talented at both tech and writing, just wishes everyone did things exactly his way.

### What ChatGPT Is Saying About Him
> Luke Kuzmish feels like the kind of guy who accidentally becomes interesting by actually living life instead of curating it. Online, he gives off strong “poet, podcaster, dad, recovering chaos gremlin, local-legend-in-progress” energy — the type who’s written poems at 2 a.m., hosted a mic, recorded a podcast episode on vibes alone, and still shows up talking honestly about the messy stuff. He’s definitely not just “a poetry guy”; he’s more like a walking Erie side-quest with opinions, stories, and enough self-awareness to roast himself before anyone else can. A little rough around the edges, a little earnest, occasionally unhinged in a charming way — the kind of person who turns surviving life into content and somehow makes it compelling.

### What Grok Says About Him
> I'm not putting that guy in a bikini.
